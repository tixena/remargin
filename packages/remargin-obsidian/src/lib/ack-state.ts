 *    - pill is always a non-interactive label.
 *    - kebab carries a single mutually-exclusive action: `Unack` when
 *      the viewer is in the ack list, `Ack` otherwise. Acking your own
 *      comment from the main card clutters the UI, so it lives in the
 *      kebab for this rare case.
 * 2. Viewer has acked (and is not the author): label on card, `Unack`
 *    in kebab.
 * 3. Viewer has not acked: interactive button on card, no ack item in
 *    the kebab (the button IS the entry point).
